                    A frequent shopper of Cub Foods, Future President Pearson has always dreamed big and pushed the
                    boundaries of what is possible his entire career, devoting his life to building computers, roms
                    and the American Dream. This was brought to life by a movement he inspired in the people of
                    Nintendo of America when he announced his candidacy for President of the United States in
                    October 2020.
